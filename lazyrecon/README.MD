# Usage

`./lazyrecon.sh target.com`

# About

This script is intended to automate your reconnaissance process in an organized fashion by performing the following:

- Create a dated folder with recon notes
- Grab subdomains using Sublist3r and certspotter
- Grab a screenshot of responsive hosts 
- Grab the response header
- Perform nmap 
- Perform dirsearch 
- Generate a HTML report with output from the tools above

This requires [Bug Bounty Hunting Tools](https://github.com/nahamsec/bbht) in order for the tools to work. 

**Warning:** This code was originally created for personal use for myself, so it's  a bit messy and hopefully it'll be cleaned up with more features in a later release.
