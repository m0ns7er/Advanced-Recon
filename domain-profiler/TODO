  - Write spec tests for ip-to-asn
  - The DNS class could use some cleaning up.
  - Strict input checking (run simplify on domain names first!)

Decisions that cost money:
  - Registrar
  - Web host
  - DNS host
  - Mail host
  - SSL Issuer
  - SSL Certificate type

Decisions that don't necessarily cost money:
  - Where are images are hosted?
  - SPF records, and values thereof
  - TTL on DNS records
  - Expiration date for domain
  - Expiration date for ssl certificate
  - Is there more than one result for the A, MX, or NS records?
    - If so, are they in different Autonomous Systems?
  - Are all services (A, MX, NS) in the same AS?
  - Does the main webpage have valid XHTML?
  - What type of frontend?
  - What type of mailserver?
  - What type of DNS server?
  - Is there a * record in DNS?
