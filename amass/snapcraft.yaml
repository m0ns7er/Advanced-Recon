summary: In-Depth Subdomain Enumeration
description: |
  The amass tool searches Internet data sources, performs brute-force 
  subdomain enumeration, searches web archives, and uses machine learning
  to generate additional subdomain name guesses. DNS name resolution
  is performed across many public servers so the authoritative server
  will see the traffic coming from different locations.
